   - All foreign keys established correctly
   - All indexes created properly
   - No errors or warnings

✅ Rollback Test: PASSED
   - All tables dropped cleanly
   - No orphaned data
   - Migrations table preserved

✅ Schema Verification: PASSED
   - users table: correct structure with organization_id
   - leads table: all tracking fields present
   - announcements table: includes dispatched_at
   - Foreign keys: all relationships intact

================================================================================
                        DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

FOR FRESH INSTALLATIONS:
  1. Configure .env with database credentials
  2. Run: php artisan migrate --force
  3. Run: php artisan passport:install
  Done! ✅

FOR EXISTING DATABASES (PRODUCTION):
  ⚠️ CRITICAL: Backup database first!
  
  1. Backup: mysqldump -u user -p db > backup.sql
  2. Ensure old migrations ran: php artisan migrate --force
  3. Stop app: php artisan down
  4. Clear migrations: TRUNCATE TABLE migrations;
  5. Run baseline: php artisan migrate --force
  6. Start app: php artisan up
  7. Verify: Check tables and test features
  
  See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions

================================================================================
                         TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: "Table already exists"
Solution: You have old schema. Follow existing database procedure.

Issue: Foreign key errors
Solution: Check for orphaned data. Clean up before migration.

Issue: Application errors after migration
Solution: 
  - php artisan cache:clear
  - php artisan config:clear
  - php artisan optimize

================================================================================
                         FILES CHANGED
================================================================================

NEW FILES:
  + database/migrations/2025_01_01_000000_create_baseline_schema.php
  + database/migrations_archive/README.md
  + database/migrations_archive/.gitkeep
  + MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
  + DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATION_STEPS.md
  + MIGRATION_SUMMARY.txt

MODIFIED FILES:
  ~ Dolphin_Backend/README.md (added migration warning)
  ~ README.md (added migration note)

MOVED FILES (74):
  → All migration files moved to database/migrations_archive/

================================================================================
                         BENEFITS ACHIEVED
================================================================================

✅ Eliminates migration order dependencies
✅ Fixes schema drift issues
✅ Faster deployment (1 migration vs 74)
✅ Easier to understand current schema
✅ Reduced deployment failures
✅ Single source of truth
✅ Simplified maintenance
✅ Better testing capability

================================================================================
                       ROLLBACK PROCEDURE
================================================================================

If you need to revert (EMERGENCY ONLY):

  1. Restore database from backup
  2. Copy archived migrations back:
     cp database/migrations_archive/*.php database/migrations/
  3. Remove baseline migration:
     rm database/migrations/2025_01_01_000000_create_baseline_schema.php
  4. Verify: php artisan migrate:status

⚠️ Note: This will reintroduce the original migration issues!

================================================================================
                         FUTURE MIGRATIONS
================================================================================

Going forward:
  - Create NEW migration files for schema changes
  - DO NOT modify the baseline migration
  - Keep migrations small and focused
  - Test thoroughly in staging before production
  
When to create a new baseline:
  - After accumulating many migrations (50+)
  - When schema becomes too complex
  - Before major version releases
